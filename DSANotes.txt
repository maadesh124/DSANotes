1.Array two Pointer best practices
	-use while instead of for loop
	-update(increment or decrement) only one pointer in each iteration
	-use continue statements
	
2.Array when upper and lower limits of arr[i] is known(conditions like 1<=arr[i]<=N).works only for Integers
	-you can store 2 numbers in arr[i] one should follow above condition.
		let 'a' and 'b' be two numbers, a<=N
		arr[i]=b*N +a;
		when you need 'b' just perform arr[i]/N, when you need 'a' perform arr[i]%N.

3.Array -bit manipuation.examples: find missing number
	-XOR is commutative and associative
	-a^b^c^d=d^c^a^b can be calculated in any oreder (associative property)
	-a^a=0 ,0^a=a^0=a.
